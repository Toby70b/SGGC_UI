                        I belong to a group of 5-6 20 something friends whose primary hobby is gaming, as such we
                        all have steam accounts with each of us owning at least 200 games. We all prefer to play
                        games together, we don’t mind replaying games, including older games, if it means we can
                        play
                        together. We would occasionally ask what games we have in common, however since steam only
                        allows users to compare their lists with one other user at a time this task was very
                        tedious. I wanted more excuses to practice on REST APIs so I researched Steam's API and
                        once I discovered it was feasible to make a tool that could compare multiple users lists for
                        common games I decided to make this tool.

                        So over time the Steam API loses information on games still owned by users. This can be
                        because it’s been pulled off steam,
                        or the developer has accidentally created duplicate entries. Because of my requirements (We
                        wanted all possible multiplayer games showed)
                        I decided that in these cases the game should still appear in the list of multiplayer games.
